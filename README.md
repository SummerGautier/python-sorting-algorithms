Recursive and Iterative implementation of various sorting algorithms
## Algorithms
+ Selection sort
    - Look in the list for the smallest item and swap that item with the item at the first index of the list. Repeat this for the second smallest, third smallest, etc. until the list is sorted.
+ Insertion sort
    - With the first two items of the list, sort them in the correct order. Then, insert the third item into the sorted subset of the list. Repeat with the fourth item, fifth item, etc. Keep inserting items into the sorted subset until all items in the list have been sorted.
