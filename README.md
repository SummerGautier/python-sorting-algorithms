# python-sorting-algorithms
Recursive and Iterative implementation of various sorting algorithms
## Algorithms
+ Selection sort
    - Look in the list for the smallest item and swap that item with the item at the first index of the list. Repeat this for the second smallest, third smallest, etc. until the list is sorted.
+ Insertion sort
    - Create a new list. Look at the original unsorted list for the smallest item and move it from the unsorted list into the the new list (a.k.a 'sorted' list). Repeat this until the unsorted list is empty and all items have been allocated to the new list.
