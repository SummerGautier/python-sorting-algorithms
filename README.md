# python-sorting-algorithms
Recursive and Iterative implementation of various sorting algorithms
## Algorithms
+ Selection sort
    - Look in the list for the smallest item and swap that item with the item at the first index of the list. Repeat this for the second smallest, third smallest, etc. until the list is sorted.
+ Insertion sort
    - Look in the list for the smallest item and move it from the unsorted list into the sorted list. Repeat this until the unsorted list is empty and all items have been allocated to the sorted list.
